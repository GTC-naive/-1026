Shareing a classic poem written by Byron with you.
                                      --2020.12.4 NIGHT
         I SAW THEE’WEEP
                       ——George Gordon Byron
  I saw thee weep the big bright tear
  Came out that eye of blue
  And then me thought it did appear
  A violet dropping dew
  I see thee smile
  the sapphire’s blaze
  Beside thee ceased to shine
  It could not match the living rays
  That filled that glance of thine.
  As clouds from yonder sun receive
  A deep and mellow dye
  Which scarce the shade of coming eve
  Can banish from the sky
  Those smiles unto the moodiest mind
  Their own pure joy impart
  Their sunshine leaves a glow behind
  That lightens on the heart
